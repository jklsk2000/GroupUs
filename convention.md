## Coding Convention 

Coding Convention for team SOLID

## Branch Convention

1. Create an issue under 'Issues' 
2. Create a local branch named after your issue number, ex) #3 
3. Work on the task under the branch that you created in the previous step 
4. Once you are done with your task, push your branch to remote 
5. Merge message will appear
    -    If there is no merge conflict, automatically merge to the main branch 
    -    If there is a merge conflict, resolve the conflict on VSCode or Github Desktop, and try to push again
6. Once you successfully merge your branch into main, you can delete your feature branch
